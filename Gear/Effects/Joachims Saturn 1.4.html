<h2>SATURN - all-purpose vintage degrader</h2>

<b>Temperature input</b><br>
Tone control as the first thing in the input chain
<br><br>

<b>Record noise level</b><br>
This parameter adds vinyl scratches at 33 rpm. If the value says "Missing file!",
you should re-download the plugin from <a href="http://buzz.robotplanet.dk/">www.buzzmachines.com</a>
and make sure that "Joachims Saturn.raw" is located in gear/effects/ (the same
directory as Joachims Saturn.dll).<br><br>Be careful about replacing this file
with another, because your .bmx file will then be incompatible with other people's bmx files.
However, I've decided to include some variations anyway. The default is "Joachims Saturn 1.4 06.raw".
If you want another kind of vinyl scratch noise, just copy one of the other ones over "Joachims Saturn 1.4.raw".
<br><br>
If you need constant vinyl noise going, there's an attribute for this.
The vinyl scratch audio is currently optimized for 96 Khz samplerate.
If you work at 
<br><br>

<b>Room Size</b> and <b>Room Level</b><br>
With this you can add reverb to make stuff sound like they're recorded at a distance.
This is also a useful trick when trying to make stuff sound retro.<br>
The Room Size parameter also controls the fading out of the vinyl noise - even if
Room Level is set to "OFF".
<br><br>

<b>Bit degrader</b><br>
Maximum bit resolution. This is useful when emulating old digital equipment like e.g.
an Amiga that (usually) has only 8-bit sound output.
<br><br>

<b>Samplerate degrader</b><br>
Also useful when emulating old digital equipment. This filter does <i>not</i> have an
anti-aliasing filter, so new frequencies will be introduced.
<br><br>

<b>Antique</b> (with volume compensation)<br>
Makes stuff sound like old rusty equipment by changing the EQ in a special way.
<br><br>

<b>Detune level</b> and <b>Detune speed</b><br>
Good for simulating record and tape players.
<br><br>

<b>Ring modulation</b> and <b>Ring mod. Mix</b><br>
Considering the name of this plugin, i just had to add it! &nbsp; ;-)
<br><br>

<b>Overdrive</b><br>
Retro gear tend to slightly and gradually overdrive at high gain.
<br><br>

<b>Overdrive Shape</b><br>
When set to 0 you get transistor-like distortion. When other values might resemble tube distortion more.
<br><br>

<b>Temperature output</b><br>
Same as Temperature input, but is placed at the output of the effect.
<br><br>

<b>Highpass filter</b><br>
This 12 dB/oct filter was mainly thought as a DC removal tool, but can ofcourse also be used as a normal highpass filter.
